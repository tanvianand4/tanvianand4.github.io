<b>12:00</b> -- post- bureaucratic-nightmare. Got my sublease agreement finalized at the Zurich student housing cooperative office on Langstrasse. Weird hours -- 9am to 12pm from Monday to Thursday. Unresponsive and rude, but my document did get signed. 
I entered a bookshop because I saw a Bourdieu piece ("Questions de sociologie") in the discount bin. 
The bookshop was called "Buchhandlung im Volkshaus" and it specialized in "Literatur, Politik and Psychoanalyse." The children's section had an illustrated biography of Frantz Fanon. The English section -- Emma Cline and the Polysecure book series. bell hooks' <i>All About Love</i>. Radikal...
<br>
<b>18:00</b> -- went on a walk with D., a conceptual architect and performance artist. 
He designed public transportation stations in Ahmedabad during his exchange year. We spoke about projections, kitchens, cultural capital, India, Switzerland, New York (he lived there briefly). We walked along the river, observing our built environment. Zürich is a weird city. Went inside a post-industrial shopping center. Not a particularly high-end one, either. Typical run-of-the mill supermarket, pharmacy, sporting goods shop. 
It was barren. The steel frames and machinery were intact.
<br>
<b>21:00</b> -- went to Helsinkiklub for a soli-concert for the trans safety fund. It's an interesting venue. Next to the Hardbrücke train station. They have a jukebox where you can select Stereolab CDs. Beer -- 6CHF. Local. The bartender had a grown-out Chelsea cut. 
<br> 
The crowd was young, queer. Mainly art students, filmmakers. Some old Zürich punks. The <i>"Züri Szeni"</i> (as they call it) has some distinctive markers. Slim Adidas zip-up jumper. Big trousers (parachute or jeans). Bedazzled hats. Hand-rolled cigarettes. Freitag cross-body. Shaggy hair or slicked-back. White.
I saw the same punk band that struck me at the minigolf lot: <a href="https://mx3.ch/t/1Oi2">Manic Pixxies</a>. Follows a clear lineage of slightly shitty band names (from Bratmobile to Mannequin Pussy).
They opened with a cover of Mannequin Pussy's Romantic and ended with a cover of Kleenex's "Nice." Originals ("Pissing inside the band-room", "Clit") were sandwiched in-between. 
<br>
After the show, I spoke to I., one of the members of the band. They (as in the band), do this funny thing where they rotate instruments throughout the show. Would be interesting to interview for my radio show. 
I also met a filmmaker, B. She told me about her upcoming film -- it's unscripted, and she made the characters after the casting call. I spoke to them about the <i>"Züri Szeni"</i>. It's certainly small -- the same group of people seem to be at these events. Scene report coming soon.

<b>17:00</b> -- Minigolf Hard. Near the slaughterhouse. On an abandoned lot. Tractors. Each minigolf level is an art installation. We struggled with the "post-humanist" level both conceptually and technically. The ball kept getting stuck.
<br>
There was a fun riot grrrl band playing called the Manic Pixxies. Tried speaking to them after their show but they disappeared.
<br>
<b>22:13</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Ambient music performance art by <a href="https://oszilot.com/">Oszilot</a>. They connected household objects to a string, serving as pendulums of different masses with different oscillations. The soundscape was fantastic. All the objects were connected to bluetooth sensors which hook up to MIDI keyboards. A fascinating technical feat that requires five Macbooks.

<b>21:45</b> -- at Zentralwäscherei. One iced tea. Alone. Reading. Annie Ernaux, "Mémoire de fille."
<br>
<b>23:56</b> -- queer Arab soli-fest. Next to Hardbrücke train station. Open to all. Not many queers, even fewer Arabs. 
<br>
<br>
I met J. -- butch revolutionary. Fussball (table) champion.
<br>
S. -- good hair. Buys cream from Dominican store. Grandparents have a farm.
<br>
A. -- "moved for the cows"

<b>23:00</b> -- at Heldenbar I met two dancers from New York. Turns out they were backup dancers for Dorian Electra. We were more or less the only people at this bar who weren't white. No lesbians at this non-profit, collectively-run, ephemeral bar. Just the manicured corporate cis gay man. No one wanted to play on the Fussball table.

<b>00:56</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Met D., architect. With his friends from architecture school. Performance art at the club. Cavernous, sofas and candlelight. A surgery of sorts. Result: slightly shitty cyber-tattoo on a mannequin. DJ set afterwards. Had an ice tea. </p>

<b>02:52</b> -- Feministisches Streikkollektiv Soli-Party at Provitreff. The DJ was wearing a keffiyeh and played a remix of "Shade by IAMDBB." It took me out -- hilarious. It was fun to dance like crazy in a room where nobody knows who I am.
<br>
<b>03:40</b> -- sitting outside the venue, by the river. Spoke to someone who runs a record label in Bern called Forcefield Records. Queer-feminist Swiss-German Rap. 
<br>
<b>20:35</b> -- Cabaret Voltaire. Birthplace of the Dadaist movement. Completely empty. I'm in a concrete box of sorts. Sitting on a spartan, yet incredibly well-designed wooden chair. The man at the bar was nice and I got my favourite tea. Moroccan Mint from Sirocco.
5 CHF: not great, but not terrible price-wise. 
<br>
I'm alone at this bar apart from one other man. He's drinking a cocktail and writing in his notebook. It's a big, loopy cursive. We haven't acknowledged each other. 
<br>
As I walked into the bar, there were three women -- probably around my age. I couldn't get a read on them. They drank three espressos -- one each. They then left. 
<br>
<b>22:49</b> -- café Zähringer. Next to the corporate gay bar "Kweer" (where the bathrooms have 40CHF hand soap and a Dyson hand-dryer). 
<br>
Lots of youth. It's next to the Zentralbibliothek. Collectively-run. They do readings on occasion. I got a small beer "vom fass." The cheapest. The waiter is an interesting character. Jumpy -- a feat of a mullet with shaved sides that clump into two hemispheres.
