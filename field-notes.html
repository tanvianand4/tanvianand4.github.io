<b>19:16</b> -- Ambient Music set for a 5pm-5am Soli-Party at Zentralwäscherei for  "Captain Support," an NGO helping those accused of 'facilitating illegal immigration' who are actually fleeing warzones or oppressive regimes in their home countries but are then tortured under the violent apparatus of the EU's hyper-militarized Frontex border network. Switzerland is complicit in this, donating hundreds of millions francs in taxpayer money to Frontex despite Switzerland's status as a non-EU country...
<br>
<br>
I'm in the large hall of Zentralwäscherei. There are sofas and chairs (a mélange of different types from spartan Bauhaus-adjacent wooden chairs to baroque loveseats, all most likely inheritances from the Koch Areal squat). Pamphlets, zines, posters with information on migrant justice, accompanied by candles on each table to facilitate reading. Some tables have hand-cut flowers in glass jars. The DJ is leaned over the CDJs and is smoking a cigarette. The ash is falling onto the mixer. A weird remix of Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You". 
The music then transitions into a more interesting synth-heavy piece. It was mixed with some Musique Concrète samples.
<br>
<br>
I go out back. They are making beautiful wood-fired pizzas in the industrial lot behind ZW. Chilli oil and garlic confit as garnish. All proceeds go to Captain Support. 
<br>
<br>
I go back to the room and sit on a 1920s (my guess, likely a 70s reproduction) upholstered chair. The DJ looks towards my side, drags the chair opposite me, and puts it behind her booth (which is on the other side of the room). She doesn't sit down though. There were many other chairs closer to her. 
<br>
<br>
I leave ZW shortly after this. 
<br>
<br>
It's my time to go back home, around 3 hours away from Zürich. It's a fascinating city. There's an interesting Mark Fisher-esque politics at play, though I can't quite articulate it yet. 
<br>
The institutionalization of collective spaces (ZW, Rote Fabrik), subsidized by a city that Manages The World's Capital. A city deeply marked by the youth protests of the 1980s, a forever-nostalgia for this brief subversion of power-relations. A network of squats, off-spaces that exist out of necessity in a city where the cost of a latte hovers around 7CHF ($8.50ish).

<p 
style = "font-family: futura-pt, sans-serif;
font-weight: 300;
font-style: normal;">

<b>16:57</b> -- Zähringerplatz. Near the café. I was looking for a slow place to spend my Saturday, but I'm out of luck. The café is having sone sort of local DJ showcase as an alternative to the highly-commercialized street parade (sponsored by a bank and an insurance company... sort of like a corporate Pride parade without even the guise of social equality...). Instead, I'm on the steps of a church which faces the café. 
<br>
<br> 
The streetparade is a techno-esque festival for the "good vibes only" type of crowd. There are a few distinctive groups despite this overarching similarity. Botoxed Russian women wearing nothing but thongs, fishnets, and tape to cover up their breasts. Tatooed men (lions and roses on their 'roided biceps) with Tommy Shelby haircuts and Cartier tint glasses. Ultra-tight mesh button-downs. Skinny Gen-X men with floral t-shirts and ultra-tapered shorts rolled up. Drawstring bag on their backs.
<br>
<br>
The streets of Zürich smell like piss and cheap beer. It all stuck to the bottom of my sandals. All the rubbish bins are overflowing with empty cans of those pre-mixed cocktails you can buy at the supermarket. 
<br>
<br>
I took the train to get there. It was eventful. A stand-off. Two women in thongs and matching bras. Glitter make-up. Lip filler. A toddler in a pram. His eyes shut, his eyelids crinkling together. He thought they were naked, despite his father's reassurance. The women were nice. They tried to comfort the toddler. 
The train then stopped at Hardbrücke. There was an older man decked out in Phillip Plein with oddly tight skin. His white sneakers were encrusted with crystals. He walked out with two much younger Thai twinks dressed in linen button downs and booty shorts.

<b>22:30</b> -- Post Office Squat (again). Punk show. I forgot that the bathrooms have Dyson hand-dryers. They still work. No pictures allowed here. No one's really on their phone as a result. I like that. 
I made conversation with someone who told me about another queer FLINTA football group. There seems to be a disparate network of them in the city. They had no idea that there was another group doing the same thing. I suggested they join forces and become a mega-group.
<br>
Toured the "free shop": Ska-punk t-shirts, ironic weed puns ("Sweed" -- Swiss weed). Pre-professional Zara attire. An eclectic selection.
<br>
First act: Hardcore Feminist rap in Swiss-German. The rapper was dykey, shaved sides -- mohawk-esque. I could only parse out "patriarchiat" and "kapitalismus" and the references to riot grrrl bands (7 Year Bitch, Bikini Kill...).
<br>
Fantastic crowd. Old dykes with French crops and statement glasses. Punk-mamas and their teenage kids. Pink-haired high schoolers. Freitag-bagged Züri-Szeni in Adidas Trackies. The whole lot.  
<br>
<br>
<b>23:51</b> -- I played what is most likely the last game of table-football I will ever play. I was bad, very bad. My teammate was this middle aged guy who was very eager to play. He was good. Very good. 
There's this band setting up on stage. Dyke drummer. Guitarist looks like a software dev who runs Linux on his modular Framework laptop. 
<br>
<br>
There's really something special about the Zürich DIY scene. Safe spaces are created by these awareness teams who brief you about the politics of the space before you enter -- it's an alternative nightlife selection process rather than the (now-infamous) manufactured exclusivity (under the guise of "safer spaces") I experienced in Berlin (with the likes of Berghain). Perhaps it's a necessary evil in Berlin.
<br>
In Zürich, though, it's up to you to decide whether you "belong" in this space (on an ideological -- politically, not aesthetic basis). I saw this "Awareness-Concept" everywhere I went in Zürich (ZW, Mikro, Held*innen Bar, Rote Fabrik...). It makes the space more interesting, more democratic even.

<b>12:57</b> -- Zürich HB. I'm sitting in the main hall of the station. It's my day off work today.
I'm on a bench. The guy next to me is charging his phone. He's wearing a "Real Eyes Realize Real Lies" t-shirt in cursive font. 
<br>
<br>
It's been a while since I've taken field notes. I've fallen into an inevitable rhythm -- football on Tuesday, take the train home on Friday. Things are slower, but I needed it. 
<br>
<br>
Last Sunday, I took a welding course at Dynamo. My instructor was a mechanic. An ex-teenage breakdancer. He sews his own clothes in Dynamo's textile studio, b-boy baggy jeans made from denim found off Langstrasse. 
During our lunch break, he produced four boxes out of his rucksack. All delicious vegan salads. He cut up a whole watermelon. We spoke about our vegetarian lifestyles. The guy next to me, a mushroom farmer, was also a vegetarian.
I loved working with metal -- my instructor said that you can't really make mistakes with metal since you can always sand it down, melt it, or cut it off. I like the many forms it takes. I was drawn in and ended up going to the studio
quite a few times to work on my own projects.

<p 
style = "font-family: futura-pt, sans-serif;
font-weight: 300;
font-style: normal;">
<b>19:00</b> -- I'm on a makeshift football field in a tucked-away park just off Helvetiaplatz.
After my unfortunate adventures in queer table-football, I thought I should take a stab at the real thing.
I took up the offer from the people I had met at Held*innen Bar and joined their queer FLINTA football group. 
<br>
<br>
I've never seen a football team quite like this one. Line tattoos, unshaved, and screenprinted t-shirts from the Streikhaus. I like it. Butch. The numbers always change. Sometimes there's ten of us. Once, there were twenty (after there was another FLINTA footy group that merged with us and we played a massive game). Sometimes, a random neighborhood kid joins us.
We run across the field to warm up. Then we do some stretches, organize ourselves in a circle. Name, pronouns. I had never done this before a game of footy. 
<br>
<br>
Game's on. We create goalposts with our collective mass of Birkenstocks. I hear a lot of Swiss-German as the ball is passed from player to player. I don't totally get it (other than the occasional "Schööön" or "Megaaaa"). 
But, despite my ill attempts to intercept the ball as the more skillful players dribble across the field, my teammates are supportive. We don't keep track of the score. It's not really about football, ever. I love it. It's become my Tuesday ritual -- I will miss it dearly.

<b>21:34</b> -- at an abandoned post office... I had passed this spot once, its curved brutalist exterior was covered in graffiti and posters of years-ago protests.
It's a squat. A beautiful one, at that. I had come to this place after it was recommended to me by someone I had met in the offspace the previous evening. 
I walked up the staircase. I opened this propped door and saw a fantastic space. An ersatz bar with the cheapest pint in Zürich (4CHF). A screenprinting studio. 
Beautiful, clean gender-neutral bathrooms with showers. A terrace that overlooks the street below. An industrial kitchen where they were cooking up a delicious pay-what-you-want vegetarian Falafel dinner. Everything was made from scratch. 
We could smell the Falafel being fried. There was a well-maintained football table. Some sofas, too. 
I was there to see a punk show. Three local acts. DJ set afterwards. No phones allowed. 
<br>
<br>
There was this queercore band, RATC, that were a lot of fun. I had the same belt (Appenzeller) as the guitarists. We acknowledged it. A fun moment. 
<br>
<br>
The Zürich punk scene is incredibly welcoming. I could just strike up a conversation with anyone. Mixed crowd, too. All ages, all scenes: Skinheads (the anarchist type), art-school burnouts, white people with dreads (lol), metalheads, sultry post-punk boys in wool slacks and loose dress shirts, and run-of-the-mill punks. 
<br>
<br>
It has started to become difficult to be truly anonymous. I find this anonymity liberating. But, it's been the third event in a row where someone has come up to me asking if they recognize me from somewhere. This is almost always someone I have never spoken to, but definitely recognize. 
I list out dates and locations from these field notes: Streiki on June 14, Christopher Street Day, Feminist Soli-Party on May 25, Zähringer. We quickly find a common thread (it's usually Zentralwäscherei or Zähringer).

font-style: normal;">
<b>18:40</b> -- Went to "Held*innen Bar," an ephemeral queer FLINTA bar at the Streikhaus. A stark contrast to Heldenbar -- much more community focused. Proceeds from the drinks go to support the Streikhaus and feminist organizing in Zürich. Seemed like everyone
knew each other. And they did.
<br>
I had some dinner there which directly supports the women who made the meal, all of whom are refugees from around the world who face immense scrutiny under the apparatuses
of racist state-mandated laws that provide them with a meagre daily wage (of around 5CHF, at least in Lausanne) that is frankly not enough to even survive. The Streikhaus hosts these weekly "soli z'nacht" 
events, but had an extra one this week in celebration of Held*innen bar. I had some daal and saffron-infused rice with some sultanas. I also got a soli-bier (a classic...). It was delicious. 
<br>
I lingered around, and spoke to these lovely people sitting on a wooden bench that was set up in the entrance to the Streikhaus' (which I later learnt is on a temporary contract with the city and is set to be demolished) garden. They were lovely.
A carpenter, nursery school teacher, environmental sciences student, social worker... all around my age. Turns out most of them met through a queer FLINTA football league. They asked me to join. Tuesdays at 7 -- that's my plan now.
<br>
<b>22:22</b> -- I heard an all-too distinctive sound in the background. It pierced through the shitty and semi-ironic "I'm Blue" remix playing through the speakers. Guitar feedback. And then,</p>
<br>
<h4 style="font-family: futura-pt-bold, sans-serif;

color: red;">ONE TWO THREE FOUR!</h4>
<p 
style = "font-family: futura-pt, sans-serif;
font-weight: 300;
font-style: normal;">
Chaos. Noise. Hardcore was back. I left the Streikhaus and followed the music. The sound was coming from the building next door. It was in the courtyard of the <a href="https://www.bildung-fuer-alle.ch/eintrag/englisch">Autonomous School.</a> Still, I couldn't see anything -- the courtyard was empty. 
I kept following the sound. There was a door that was left ajar. I entered an offspace. This offspace was particularly tiny -- probably fits 40 people at most. It's called "Mikro" for good reason. 
<br>
<br>
I walked into the room. Old Zürich punks, scene-heads, and other touring musicians. The band that was on, <a href="https://lavidaesunmus.bandcamp.com/album/ular-akan-patuk">Sihir</a>, were from Berlin. They had just come in from Lausanne, where they played a squat that is coincidentally five minutes way from my old high school.
<br>
<br>
Their music was fantastic, their sound was punishing, sharp, sludgy, and exercise in masochism. I spoke to them after the show. Based in Berlin, but by way of Colombia, Nusantra, and Spain. There was also an American groupie (from Austin) who mentioned his crazy RISD ex-girlfriend in passing. He asked me about Providence, about AS220, about Nice Slice pizza. 
<br>
<br>
The band were on tour -- they hop from squat-to-squat, offspace-to-offspace. They were wondering which squat they were going to be sleeping at for the night. 
<br>
<br>
I remembered how much I cherish the punk scene. Respectful. Safe. Fun. Friendly. 
<br>
<br>
And, in true Swiss week day fashion, the show was over by midnight.

<b>13:30</b> -- Lugano, Ticino. A mish-mash of Italian-Swiss culture. Beautiful architecture. I saw a wonderful exhibition on Ernst Scheiddeger and his involvement in the Swiss avant-garde art movement from the 40s-70s. 
During this exhibition, it had dawned upon me that all of the streets near where I am temporarily living (in Zürich) are named after prominent Swiss architects -- Max-Bill-Platz, Max-Frisch-Platz, Sophie-Taeuber-Strasse. For the first time, I saw their individual work: fascinating, lively. 
It's a stark contrast to the places that bear their name: lifeless, copy-paste inoffensive flats mainly inhabited by students. A Coop megastore. 
<br>
<b>15:00ish</b> -- it's the Swiss Harley-Davidson meetup. A distinctive subculture: pot-bellied bearded middle-aged men with quasi-threatening (yet empty, but also vaguely right-wing) imagery. It's very "don't tread on me" - esque.
Wives: black hair, tattooed, black dress. Aggressive fringe. There was a perfectly palatable heavy-metal band that was playing AC/DC covers. You could win a Ford F-150 as a prize. No one really has those cars here.

<b>01:11</b> -- DJ set & live drummers. Electric. Convivial. Fantastic. A safe environment. Belly-dancers in this bunker. 
<br>
<b>03:28</b> -- I danced, lost (terribly) again at table-football. The DJ did a mashup of Dami Falesteeni and Match my Freak. The bar was manned by this 
distinctive group of art-school students that hand-roll cigarettes and have cropped hair. They continually rolled some cigarettes on the dancefloor and handed it to whatever DJ was on.

<b>14:00</b> -- biked down to the Museum für Gestaltung. I love posters and graphic design. Due to the text-based nature of these field notes, I cannot share any pictures. I saw an exhibition on women in poster design.
Instead, here is a list of the posters I enjoyed. 
<ul style = "font-family: futura-pt, sans-serif;

<br>
On a much less interesting note, I saw the featured exhibition on Olivero Toscani. Frankly, I thought his work was appalling. I am thinking about his work and its relation to Agamben's "Bare Life." Subjects reduced to their biological oddities. 
The field notes format is too nebulous for my detailed thoughts, but I have many.
<br>
<b>23:48</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Not as usual, though. They have an underground club space called "Pluto." Tonight: Soli-Party for Palestine. 
I scoped out this underground space. It's in the nuclear shelter (typical for Swiss buildings to have one). Sinks and mirrors are at the back of this room with a maximum capacity of 50 people. 
An ironic disco ball was hanging from the ceiling. I liked the cause, the music, the food (they had a Palestinian chef), and the crowd. The crowd was young, relatively mixed in terms of other demographic indicators, and I heard mixes of English, Arabic, and Swiss-German.

<b>19:27</b> -- my bike light was broken, but the bike workshop was closed so I couldn't fix it. Instead, I decided to run a different errand: getting a new pair of Birkenstocks.
My old pair (well, actually, they were my mother's) got damp and an ecosystem of sorts started forming on the footbed. It served me well -- four years.
<br>
<br>
I did some online research, and it turned out that Globus (an expensive department store) was having a sale and it was the cheapest place to buy the pair that I was looking for. 
Bourdieu, in <i>Distinction</i> writes about these certain moments of "misrecognition" when your habitus is misaligned with the field you are in. This was a classic case of said "misrecognition". I entered this shop -- sweaty (post-bike ride), wrinkled shirt, muddy shoes. 
Botox. Baccarat Rouge 540. Golden Goose sneakers. Rimowa suitcases. I was completely lost. I went upstairs to the shoe section, next to the women's clothing "sale" rack. I found the shoe I was looking for, albeit not in my size. I left the shop as quickly as possible.

<b>20:17</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Friends invited me to a queer babyfoot-apéro. Turns out my friend transported the babyfoot table from Koch Areal (a squat that the government shut down for commercial real estate). Four languages: French, Swiss-German, High-German, and English. The game's on. Three knocks on the table (and some Swiss-German word that I have completely forgotten) 
means that you challenge your opponent to a duel. I'm with some (recently-made and lovely) friends who are masters at the game. It's serious business. 
We played in rounds, with the classic Zürich bar rules: that is, a goal hit by the center row (the one with five figures) does not count. The game thus becomes much more difficult,
reliant on skill and dexterity. I'm one mate deep, but it hasn't hit me yet, my clumsiness is getting the best of me.

<b>20:35</b> -- I'm on, following a conversation about Lizzie Borden's <i>Born in Flames</i> (a favourite topic of mine...)
I'm manning the center players. It's a bit rough on my end. My teammate (good hair, buys cream from Dominican store) deeply skilled, passing from one plastic figurine to the other. A damning loss.
The other team scores a "photograph" - a move where you get the other player to score an own-goal through sly tactics (I am butchering this explanation).

<b>20:55</b> -- On again. Seemed like a damning loss was imminent. 8-3. Zürich bar rules tend to stop at eight goals. But the opposing team wanted to keep playing -- why not make the winning margin even bigger? But my (solidarity-fairtrade, of course...) mate had suddenly hit. 
I was unstoppable. Goal! Pass. Teammate -- Goal! Pass. Pass. Block. Goal! Suddenly, we had nine points. The pressure was on. Shit. Own goal. Slowly, my defence was falling apart. I let my nerves get to me. The other team scored. 
<br>
<br>
So I lost the second game, too. But it was beautiful. Glorious, even.

Despite coming dead-last in this impromptu tournament, I remain optimistic. I am going to practice and come back unstoppable. Or, as this lovely person told me that evening,
I am a good player when I am not stressed out.

<b>01:30</b> -- at Rote Fabrik. I came here once when I was fifteen to see a punk show (Priests! Sadly they are no more).
It was exactly as I remember it -- palm trees, red brick, by the lake. It's a fantastic space that markedly sticks out from its affluent, suburban surroundings.
<br>
I love the space: it was a squat in the '70s where artists and those on the margins had a space for themselves. It was then used as storage for the Zürich opera. 
Then, following youth protests for more funding for youth culture, it was turned into an established cultural venue receiving state funding. They now run it as a DIY space with studios, a restaurant, and performance spaces.

<br>
<br>
I was at Rote Fabrik to watch a leftist drag show -- it was some Swiss-German drag, and the only thing I could parse out were the names of political parties. It was fun. I doubt that it helped me improve my (very limited) Swiss-German.

<b>16:30</b> -- Christopher Street Day. Anti-capitalist, anti-pinkwashing, anti-border Pride. 
The rain was miserable. Same tractor from the Feministischer Streik was at the front of the (much smaller) demonstration. 
I found the mix of aesthetic codes to be quite interesting. Typical <i>Züri Szeni</i> as well as emo-types. Leather gays. 16-year-olds with neon hair from the surrounding suburbs. 
Drag performer with a kangol and elf ears on the trailer attached to the tractor. 
<br>
<b>18:30</b> -- I'm at this pizza restaurant at the main station. I sat at the bar, next to two American tourists. They told me about their Swiss financial planner. Surprised at the fact that there is no AC in Swiss homes. Even more surprised at the fact that I am not doing an internship in commercial banking.

<b>03:27</b> -- the Albanian DJ (who, after later research, had a work-study in commercial banking and then gave it up to become a queer feminist DJ and work in a sandwich shop) 
started playing a Bollywood song (from the 90s?) in this tiny, sweaty room inside the bunker of Zentralwäscherei. 
<br>
<b>14:13</b> -- at Zähringer. I got recognized by the person who was working there. They remembered me from seeing me at the Strike (or the Soli-Party) yesterday.

<b>17:30</b> -- <b><i>STREIK!</i></b> The 14th of June is a very important date in Switzerland. 
It marks the day of the Feministischer Streik or the Grève Féministe (as it is called in the part where I am from). 
The focus in Zürich was on Care Workers ("Carearbeit"). J (butch revolutionary fussball champ, who I later ran into at Zentralwäscherei) told me that
they were a loose group of unions. Well, sort of -- not state-recognized like say, Unia. The reality is more complicated, as it could be argued that these groups do not actually want and/or need state recognition. 
The Carearbeitsblock consisted of (among many others) teachers, social workers, food-service workers... immensely important work. 
<br>
<br>
I was at Bürkliplatz at 17:30 sharp. I was wearing my "Feminismuus" shirt (had a mouse on it) that I had screenprinted just a day prior at the Streikhaus. There were easily tens of thousands of people there.
Signs:
<p>
<ul style = "font-family: futura-pt, sans-serif;

font-style: normal;">
    <li>We are the daughters of the witches you couldn't burn (...white feminism)</li>
    <li>My pussy my choice (there was a lot of weird gender essentialism...)</li>
    <li>Jin Jiyan Azadî -- Refugees Welcome</li>
    <li>MAINSTREAM FEMINISTS: WHY WON'T YOU MARCH FOR PALESTINIAN WOMEN?</li>
</ul>

<b>19:10</b> -- a large tractor passed me by. It had purple ribbons on its windshield and the official Streiki posters wheatpasted on its body. Attached to it, a trailer. 
On the trailer: large speakers and a techno DJ. 
<br>
<b>20:04</b> -- at Helvetiaplatz. The strike dispersed here and turned into a large party with food stands, live music, and infokiosks. I must admit that I was impressed by the 
diversity of ages at this location. Aesthetically heterogenous as well -- different stylistic indicators throughout. Intensely white. 
<br>
<b>23:42</b> -- FLINTA Soli-Party at Zentralwäscherei. FLINTA is a common acronym in Western Europe and stands for <i>Femme, Lesbienne, Intersex, Transgenre, Agenre</i>. Two floors were open.
I am starting to recognize the same groups of people as I frequent these spaces. In fact, almost everyone I remembered from the Palestinian bloc of the Feminist Strike was present later in the evening.
The DJ who was playing as I entered was Tamil. 
<br>
<br>
I must admit that I am fascinated by Zentralwäscherei as a space. It's just a couple of years old. Was an unused space given to squatters of Koch Areal (one of the largest squats in the Zürich area) as the city wanted to demolish their squat to build high-rises. 
Most of the furniture is from the squat, artifacts from a time still marked in Zürich's collective memory.

<b>12:00</b> -- post- bureaucratic-nightmare. Got my sublease agreement finalized at the Zürich student housing cooperative office on Langstrasse. Weird hours -- 9am to 12pm from Monday to Thursday. Unresponsive and rude, but my document did get signed. 
I entered a bookshop because I saw a Bourdieu piece ("Questions de sociologie") in the discount bin. 
The bookshop was called "Buchhandlung im Volkshaus" and it specialized in "Literatur, Politik and Psychoanalyse." The children's section had an illustrated biography of Frantz Fanon. The English section -- Emma Cline and the Polysecure book series. bell hooks' <i>All About Love</i>. Radikal...
<br>
<b>21:00</b> -- went to Helsinkiklub for a soli-concert for the trans safety fund. It's an interesting venue. Next to the Hardbrücke train station. They have a jukebox where you can select Stereolab CDs. Beer -- 6CHF. Local. The bartender had a grown-out Chelsea cut. 
<br> 
The crowd was young, queer. Mainly art students, filmmakers. Some old Zürich punks. The <i>"Züri Szeni"</i> (as they call it) has some distinctive markers. Slim Adidas zip-up jumper. Big trousers (parachute or jeans). Bedazzled hats. Hand-rolled cigarettes. Freitag cross-body. Shaggy hair or slicked-back. White.
I saw the same punk band that struck me at the minigolf lot: <a href="https://mx3.ch/t/1Oi2">Manic Pixxies</a>. Follows a clear lineage of slightly shitty band names (from Bratmobile to Mannequin Pussy).
They opened with a cover of Mannequin Pussy's Romantic and ended with a cover of Kleenex's "Nice." Originals ("Pissing inside the band-room", "Clit") were sandwiched in-between. 
<br>
After the show, I spoke to I., one of the members of the band. They (as in the band), do this funny thing where they rotate instruments throughout the show. Would be interesting to interview for my radio show. 
I also met a filmmaker, B. She told me about her upcoming film -- it's unscripted, and she made the characters after the casting call. I spoke to them about the <i>"Züri Szeni"</i>. It's certainly small -- the same group of people seem to be at these events. Scene report coming soon.

<b>17:00</b> -- Minigolf Hard. Near the slaughterhouse. On an abandoned lot. Tractors. Each minigolf level is an art installation. We struggled with the "post-humanist" level both conceptually and technically. The ball kept getting stuck.
<br>
There was a fun riot grrrl band playing called the Manic Pixxies. Tried speaking to them after their show but they disappeared.
<br>
<b>22:13</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Ambient music performance art by <a href="https://oszilot.com/">Oszilot</a>. They connected household objects to a string, serving as pendulums of different masses with different oscillations. The soundscape was fantastic. All the objects were connected to bluetooth sensors which hook up to MIDI keyboards. A fascinating technical feat that requires five Macbooks.

<b>21:45</b> -- at Zentralwäscherei. One iced tea. Alone. Reading. Annie Ernaux, "Mémoire de fille."
<br>
<b>23:56</b> -- queer Arab soli-fest. Next to Hardbrücke train station. Open to all. Not many queers, even fewer Arabs. 
<br>
<br>
I met G. -- butch revolutionary. Fussball (table) champion.
<br>
S. -- good hair. Buys cream from Dominican store. Grandparents have a farm.
<br>
A. -- "moved for the cows"

<b>23:00</b> -- at Heldenbar I met two dancers from New York. Turns out they were backup dancers for Dorian Electra. We were more or less the only people at this bar who weren't white. No lesbians at this non-profit, collectively-run, ephemeral bar. Just the manicured corporate cis gay man. No one wanted to play on the Fussball table.

<b>00:56</b> -- Zentralwäscherei. Met an architect. With his friends from architecture school. Performance art at the club. Cavernous, sofas and candlelight. A surgery of sorts. Result: slightly shitty cyber-tattoo on a mannequin. DJ set afterwards. Had an ice tea. </p>

<b>02:52</b> -- Feministisches Streikkollektiv Soli-Party at Provitreff. The DJ was wearing a keffiyeh and played a remix of "Shade by IAMDBB." It took me out -- hilarious. It was fun to dance like crazy in a room where nobody knows who I am.
<br>
<b>03:40</b> -- sitting outside the venue, by the river. Spoke to someone who runs a record label in Bern called Forcefield Records. Queer-feminist Swiss-German Rap. 
<br>
<b>20:35</b> -- Cabaret Voltaire. Birthplace of the Dadaist movement. Completely empty. I'm in a concrete box of sorts. Sitting on a spartan, yet incredibly well-designed wooden chair. The man at the bar was nice and I got my favourite tea. Moroccan Mint from Sirocco.
5 CHF: not great, but not terrible price-wise. 
<br>
I'm alone at this bar apart from one other man. He's drinking a cocktail and writing in his notebook. It's a big, loopy cursive. We haven't acknowledged each other. 
<br>
As I walked into the bar, there were three women -- probably around my age. I couldn't get a read on them. They drank three espressos -- one each. They then left. 
<br>
<b>22:49</b> -- café Zähringer. Next to the corporate gay bar "Kweer" (where the bathrooms have 40CHF hand soap and a Dyson hand-dryer). 
<br>
Lots of youth. It's next to the Zentralbibliothek. Collectively-run. They do readings on occasion. I got a small beer "vom fass." The cheapest. The waiter is an interesting character. Jumpy -- a feat of a mullet with shaved sides that clump into two hemispheres.
